// game loop (done)
// game ends function (done)
// how to place the ships git pushon the board (done)
// improve computer ai guessing (somehow store the previous two guesses,
could have it be a queue)
// improve visuals
// Add game ends visuals
// Add new game functionality
// Add remaining ships visuals
// Recheck and revise tests

Ideas: winner popup (do this). Look at EmptyBox's board (https://emptybox12.github.io/battleship/). Misses should
be blue for water.

When you're placing the ships, have the ships names on the place board
container.
